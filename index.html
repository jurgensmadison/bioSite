            <h1>Meet Connor Pedersen</h1>
            <p>Connor Pedersen is the CEO of Arbor Axe House, a professional axe thrower, and a big supporter of the Lincoln Community. Connor has championed many community events such as the Pup Crawl, an annual adoption event for local rescues partnering with local bars in the Telegraph district.</p>
            <p>When his home axe throwing venue threatened to close, Connor couldn't bear the thought of his local axe throwing community disappearing. Instead, he took the reigns and bought the place. On September 2, 2025, Connor (along with his fiance and business partners) opened for business under the new name of Arbor Axe House.</p>
