              <h1>Meet Connor Pedersen</h1>
              <p>Connor Pedersen is the CEO of Arbor Axe House, a professional axe thrower, and a big supporter of the Lincoln Community. Connor has championed many community events such as the Pup Crawl, an annual adoption event for local rescues partnering with local bars in the Telegraph district.</p>
              <p>When his home axe throwing venue threatened to close, Connor couldn't bear the thought of his local axe throwing community disappearing. Instead, he took the reigns and bought the place. On September 2, 2025, Connor (along with his fiance and business partners) opened for business under the new name of Arbor Axe House.</p>
              <p><i>"Connor is fantastic with local vendor and local business relationships, which makes him an asset as a new business owner."</i><br>
              - Cecelia Orwig, co-owner</p>

          <h1>The World of Axe Throwing</h1>
          <div class="grid">
            <div>
              <p>Connor is an avid axe thrower. A viking at heart, Connor got into the sport during 2020. Since then, he's joined a strong community of axe throwers across the midwest. Connor has competed at the World Axe Throwing Championships three years in a row. This year, he decided to open his own axe throwing venue, Arbor Axe House.</p>
              <p>Axe throwing isn't just a unique recreational activity, it's a competitive sport. According to the World Axe Throwing League (WATL), the sport of axe throwing is trending and expanding internationally. The league strives to unite venues and throwers together and standardize the sport with rules, safety protocols, and training.</p>
